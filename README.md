# ðŸš€ Ticket Management Extension â€“ Hibernate ORM

This project is a continuation of the previous assignment on Hibernate ORM, extending the functionality by introducing a new entity: **Ticket**, and establishing entity relationships using advanced **Entity Mapping** techniques.

## âœ… What Was Added

### New Entity: `Ticket`
- Represents a space travel ticket between planets.
- Fields: `id`, `client`, `fromPlanet`, `toPlanet`, `createdAt`
- The field `createdAt` is automatically generated by the database.

###  Entity Relationships
- **Client â€” Ticket**: One-to-Many
- **Planet â€” Ticket (from/to)**: Many-to-One (twice)

###  Validation Rules
- Cannot create a ticket without:
  - a valid client
  - a valid departure planet (`fromPlanet`)
  - a valid destination planet (`toPlanet`)
- Planet ID must consist of **uppercase Latin letters and digits only** (`@Pattern`)
- Client name must be **3 to 200 characters long** (`@Size`)
